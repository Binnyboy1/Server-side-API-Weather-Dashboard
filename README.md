# Server-side-API-Weather-Dashboard

## Description

This is the 'Module 06' challenge assignment for the UCF coding bootcamp.

Based on the starter code we were given, we were tasked with creating a weather dashboard from the ground up. This project helps to build our skills with using server-side APIs and getting more familiar with them. The jist of this project is that it will show you the weather forecast based on a search prompt.
